"""Strip harness-injected content from agent turns before extraction.

Claude transcripts fold system-reminders, slash-command scaffolding, skill text,
and local-command caveats into user-role turns. Left in, these fool the
deterministic intent/candidate heuristics (e.g. skill instructions read as a user
"investigate ..." request). We remove them so extraction sees real user prose.
